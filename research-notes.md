# Research Notes - Browser Extension Security

## Key Security Concepts Learned

### Extension Permission Models
- **Host Permissions**: Allow extensions to access specific websites or all websites
- **API Permissions**: Grant access to specific browser APIs (tabs, bookmarks, etc.)
- **Content Script Permissions**: Enable injection of scripts into web pages
- **Background Permissions**: Allow extensions to run processes in the background

### Common Attack Vectors
1. **Search Hijacking**: Redirecting searches to malicious sites
2. **Data Exfiltration**: Stealing sensitive information from forms and pages
3. **Ad Injection**: Inserting unwanted advertisements into websites
4. **Credential Theft**: Capturing login credentials and session tokens
5. **Privacy Violation**: Tracking browsing habits and personal data

### Red Flag Indicators
- Extensions you don't remember installing
- Excessive permissions for the extension's stated purpose
- Poor reviews or no reviews
- Unknown or suspicious developers
- Recent installation without user action
- Extensions that modify browser settings

### Browser Security Features
- **Sandboxing**: Isolates extensions from the main browser process
- **Permission System**: Granular control over what extensions can access
- **Automatic Updates**: Keeps extensions current with security patches
- **Store Verification**: Chrome Web Store reviews extensions before publication
